<p><strong>Task 2: Fine-Tuning a Pre-trained Model for Image Classification</strong></p><p>This repository contains the solution to Task 2, which involves fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model on a custom dataset of hand-written digits (0, 1, and 2) using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to observe the accuracy of the fine-tuned model and compare it with the accuracy of the model from Task 1.</p><p><strong>Project Structure</strong></p><p>The repository is structured as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>VGG16CNN.ipynb</strong>: The Notebook containing the Python code for Task 2.</li><li><strong>hand_written_digits/</strong>: The dataset folder with subfolders for each class (0_digits, 1_digits, 2_digits).</li><li><strong>README.md</strong> (this file): Provides an overview of the project.</li></ul><p><strong>Task Description</strong></p><p>The main tasks in this assignment are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Data Split</strong>: The custom dataset is split into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). This split is done programmatically.</li><li><strong>Pre-trained Model</strong>: A pre-trained deep learning model (VGG16) is used as the base model for fine-tuning. The top layers are replaced with custom layers for the classification task.</li><li><strong>Data Augmentation</strong>: Data augmentation is applied to the training set using TensorFlow's <strong>ImageDataGenerator</strong>. Augmentation includes rotation, width and height shifts, shear, and zoom. Vertical and horizontal flips are disabled to maintain data integrity.</li><li><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong>: The pre-trained VGG16 model's base layers are frozen, and custom classification layers are added. The model is then fine-tuned on the custom dataset.</li><li><strong>Model Training</strong>: The fine-tuned model is trained on the training set for a specified number of epochs.</li><li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: The accuracy of the fine-tuned model is evaluated on the validation set.</li></ol><p><strong>How to Use</strong></p><ol><li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li></ol><p><strong>git clone https://github.com/luqmanayub/VGG16CNN.git&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Open and run the&nbsp;<strong>VGG16CNN.ipynb</strong> Notebook to see the code and results.</li><li>Ensure that you have the required libraries installed, such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and matplotlib. You can install them using pip:</li></ol><p><strong>pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Run the cells in the notebook to fine-tune the pre-trained model and evaluate its accuracy.</li></ol><p><strong>Validation accuracy (Fine-tuned VGG16 Model): 0.9914255142211914</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>This assignment demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification on a custom dataset. The accuracy achieved by the fine-tuned model is compared with the accuracy of the model from Task 1. Fine-tuning leverages knowledge learned from a larger dataset, making it a powerful technique for smaller datasets.</p>
